FOR LATER
 ☐ Replace png hitarea of piano keys with svg or easeljs internal drawing

 ☐ Reimplement with MVC architecture and possibly redesign data structure
   ☐ Investigate flattening json manifest to make loading easier and more centralized
   ☐ Search for online code examples of MVC pattern being used with createjs/easel.
   ☐ Investigate use of backbone
     ☐ How would inheritance work for createjs classes like Containers?

 ☐ Reimplment using decorator pattern for instruments / components
